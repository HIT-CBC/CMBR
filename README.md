# An integrative DNA methylation and functional network framework for conserved subtyping of HR + breast cancer

Positive hormone receptor (HR+) breast cancer (BC) accounts for a high proportion of patients with BC. Clinically, the heterogeneity of HR+BC leads to different therapeutic effects on endocrine. Therefore, definition of subgroups in HR+ BC is important for effective treatment. In this work, we developed a CMBR method based on computational functional network to screen for ‘MF genes’ to identify subgroups in HR+ BC. CMBR identified meaningful subgroups based on DNA methylation of "MF gene" and these conserved subgroups were validated on various external validation sets.CMBR described the molecular signature of the HR+ BC subgroups, which helped inform individualized treatment decisions and management options.
